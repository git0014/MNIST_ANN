# MNIST_ANN
Project Goals:
•	Train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.
•	Showcase the implementation of a feed forward neural network architecture using popular deep learning library Keras.
Project Components:
1.	Data Preprocessing:
•	Loading and understanding the MNIST dataset.
•	Data exploration and visualization to gain insights into the dataset.
•	Data preprocessing steps like normalization to achieve faster convergence of the optimizer. 
2.	Neural Network Architecture:
•	Defining the number of layers, neurons, and activation function. Activation function used is ReLU. 
3.	Training the Model:
•	Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
•	Configuring the model training process, including loss functions and optimizers.
•	Training the model using forward and backward passes (back propagation).
4.	Model Evaluation:
•	Evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset.
•	Measuring accuracy.
5.	Model Testing:
•	Using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen handwritten digits.
6.	Dependencies:
•	TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib
